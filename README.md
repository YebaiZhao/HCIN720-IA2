The Cloud_01 is an early try of using a gravity sensor to control the camera moving in a 3D screen. Inspired by a example code from Three.js http://threejs.org/examples/

The Cloud_02 folder contains a fun little game using the Photon as a controller to fly a spaceship. Modified from Paper.js example library.

The local folder has the local version, with better control and a blinking blue led we your ship died.
